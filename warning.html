When it comes to the world of collecting anything, there are people out there that are aware that collectors seek certain items and will pay nearly any price to ensure they can get their hands on it, the same term will especially apply to games.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">You might have checked out the <a href="/halloffame.html">most sought-after games</a> that are being hunted by collectors worldwide and if you looked at some of the prices, you would think this is insane.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">But it is not, it is very real. Some collectors will pay <i>nearly any price</i> to get their hands on a game and there's even more sellers that will make falsified copies in hopes of tricking the collectors into purchasing their knockoff goods.</p>
                        <p>  </p>
                        <p class="fs-5">This page is here to warn you of signs to look out for when purchasing games. Companies like Nintendo were aware of these fakes and set to making these games with their own unique marks so people would know the genuine articles from the fakes.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">It's worth noting that these tips are mostly for games from the cartridge era, as increased security in discs were much more complicated to be copied.</p>

                        <div class="col-lg-6 fs-4">Though more obvious in cartridges than discs, one can easily tell it's fake if the cartridge is a different color or a cheaper material. <b>Nintendo</b> took it a step further and added specific details in their logo, note how the "i" has a square dot instead of a round one. Something that proves this cartridge is genuine. Another way to find out is by opening the cartridge and ensuring the correct chip is used.</div>

But that doesn't mean every single seller is going to try to rip you off.</p>
                  <p class="fs-3">There have been sellers that look at the average prices of these games and realize that for the average consumer that can't afford to pay for the game as it is and decide to make <i>reproduced copies</i> or <b>reproductions</b> so that you can have a certain game for a system without having to break your wallet just to own it.</p>
