                          <p class="fs-4">The other day, I was looking around online and a seller I once bought from asked me if I was interested in taking a load off of him, so I asked him what he had. I had never seen such a great collection of games, some of which I wanted, but didn't have the money for. Instead, I had settled for some Gameboy games and one Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64. It got me to thinking about methods that the buyers have to go through in order to get the best prices. It was one of the many reasons I started this site and it's still going strong!</p>

                <p class="about-text lead">I have always been a fan of videogames, ever since I began playing on my parents' iMac G3 at 2 years old, but the collecting didn't start until I was much older and it would only be encouraged further by the friends I have, who are also collectors in their own right. I learned from my experiences collecting and now I'm here to teach you what I know!</p>
