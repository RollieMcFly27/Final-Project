Amazon doesn't have it as bad as eBay, but it's still a gamble and more often than not, you're paying more for the game than you would have otherwise.</dd>

                    <dd class="col-md-8 text-center">Stores like <b>GameStop</b> were once your one-way ticket to getting games you couldn't get anywhere else. But in the recent years, these stores began to suffer under the economy and were forced to either sell other items to make ends meet or they raised the prices or they did even worse: both.</dd>

                    <dd class="col-md-8 text-center">No matter where you are or where you're buying from, when you buy a game, it's always good to check online for the average price. There's no specific place you need to go to for these prices, just simply check how much it usually goes for. It also helps to have an expert who knows the average prices well enough.</dd>

                    <dd class="col-md-8 text-center">Look around for local game shops in your city and check their average prices, there's always going to be a few that follow in GameStop's footsteps in terms of pricing, but then there's honest shops that treat their customers fairly and price the items at market value or even lower. When you find a shop like this, become a regular! You never know what good will come from it!</dd>
